Dbms:
  ->Dbms stands for the database management system
  -> It is software or application that allows to insert, update, delete, and manage the database
  -> Database->Processed information.

There are 5 types of DBMS Languages
              
  1 DDL-DDL statements are used to specify the schema of the 
    database.
  DDL commands-create, drop, alter, rename
  Syntax-create database Db_name
  create database School
  
Table Creation
  table statement is used  to create a table
  create table table_name( column_name datatype,column_name datatype,.....)
  create table tb_staff(s_name varchar(10),s_id int,s_mobile int))
  To see Table Structure 
  DESCRIBE staff;

DROP TABLE Statement
  drop statement is used to delete a table
  drop table tb_name
  drop table tb_staff

ALTER TABLE Statement
  Alter statement is used to add, modify, and delete the column in the existing table.
  ALTER TABLE - ADD Column
  alter table tb_name(column_name Data_type)
  alter table tb_staff salary int

ALTER TABLE - DROP COLUMN
  The Alter command is used to delete a column in an existing table
  Syntax-
  alter table table_name drop column_name
  alter table tb_staff drop salary;

ALTER TABLE-MODIFY COLUMN
  It is used to change a data type in a column
  alter table table_name existing_column_name change datatype name
  alter table table _name

TRUNCATE-TO DELETE TABLE DATA(EMPTY TABLE)
  Syntax-
  truncate table_name;
  ex truncate tb_staff;
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
2 DML-DML Statements are used to manipulate/change data in the database. 
    DML Commands-insert, update, delete
    Insert statement:- Insert statement is used to add a new record in a table
    Syntax -insert into table_name (column_name1,column_name2......)values(C1_value,c2_value,c3_value3)
    Ex-insert into table_name (s_name,s_id,s_mobile) values("Rohit",1,812056)
    select *from table_name;

    UPDATE COMMAND: Update command used to modify the existing record of a table.
    update table_name set column1=value,coulumn2=value2,column3=value3 where condition
    update tb_staff set s_name="Rohit" where s_id=101;

    A delete statement is used to delete a record in the table
    delete from table_name where condition
    EX- delete from tb_staff where s_id="101";

3   DQL-DQL Stands for Data Query Language.
        ->DQL statement is used to retrieve a record from a table.
        syntax
        select * from table_name where condition
        Ex select S_name * from tb_staff where s_id="101"
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
4   DCL -
*Full-form Data control language
* Dcl statements are used to control user access privileges
* Privileges-Insert, update, delete, All privileges, etc

* There are two commands in DCL Statements-
 	1 GRANT Command-It is used to give privileges to the user
		Syntax-

		Grant Privileges on DataBase_name.Table_name to yogesh@hostName;
		Ex-

		GRANT SELECT ON school. staff to yogesh@localhost;

		
 	2 REVOKE Command - The REVOKE statement is used to remove permission/privileges from a user that was previously granted
		Syntax

		REVOKE PRIVILEGES ON DATABASE_NAME.TABLE_NAME FROM USER_NAME@HOSTNAME;

		EX

		REVOKE SELECT ON school. staff from yogesh@hostname;
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	Extra Commands
	User Creation
 	 CREATE USER 'username'@'hostname' IDENTIFIED BY 'password';
	To Drop user
	DROP USER 'username'@'hostname';
	Ex
	DROP USER yogi@localhost;
  	create database yo;
	To see User
 	select user from mysql.user;
	Show databases
 	 SHOW TABLES FROM urdatabase_name;
	Select database
	  USE clg;
 	 show databases;
	TO SEE tables
	show tables;
 	 Exit MySQL/logout user from mysql
   	 \q
	Note *After executing the REVOKE statement, you need to run FLUSH PRIVILEGES; to apply the changes immediately:
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	5. TCL stands for Transaction control language.
	TCL statements are used to control transactions in the database.
	There are two tcl statements-
	* COMMIT- This command is used to permanently save the changes made during the current transaction.
	 COMMIT;
	* ROLLBACK: This command is used to undo the changes made during the current transaction.
	ROLLBACK;
	* ROLLBACK TO SAVEPOINT: This command rolls back the current transaction to a specified savepoint.
	ROLLBACK TO SAVEPOINT savepoint_name;
	5 Entry save point k bad tuna hi roll back Karega

Key
DBMS
7 types of key
ACC -SPUF
1   Alternate Key
2   Composite key
3   candidate key
4   super key
5   primary key
6   unique key
7   foreign key

1 Super key- a set of attributes that can uniquely identify a record

Ex (P_id,P_name)

2 Candidate Key-
* Minimal set of super key.
* In a table, there can be multiple candidate keys
* Each candidate key must be unique across all records in the table.
* The candidate key is a potential primary key but is not necessarily chosen as the primary key.
Ex P_id
3 Primary Key
 the primary key has two property
 1>Unique
 2>NotNull
Ex UID
3 Foreign key-foreign key is a field (or collection of fields) in one table, that refers to the primary key in another table
CREATE TABLE students (
    student_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    student_name VARCHAR(50)
);
create table Booking(
Book_id int primary key,
date_of_issue date,
foreign key (student_id) REFERENCES student(student_id));

Composite key- A composite key is the combination of two or more attributes that can uniquely a record.
CREATE TABLE student_enrollment (
    student_id INT,
    course_id INT,
    enrollment_date DATE,
    PRIMARY KEY (student_id, course_id)
);
